You have been given bulk RNA-seq expression data (IGSE267554) comparing Aβ-treated human astrocytes to untreated controls in an Alzheimer’s disease (AD) model. The treatment was applied over 12h, and differential gene expression was assessed. Using the provided files and the following analysis pipeline (fastq.gz -> qfastp trimming → BBMap reformat.sh subsampling → HISAT2 alignment → featureCounts quantification → DESeq2 differential expression), answer the following questions:
